# Sales Database

This project contains a database schema and queries that can be used to track sales data. The schema includes tables for customers, products, orders, and order items. The queries can be used to retrieve data from the tables, such as the total revenue generated by each product, the most popular products, and the top customers.

## Schema

The schema for the sales database includes the following tables:

* **Customers:** This table stores information about customers, such as their name, address, and phone number.
* **Products:** This table stores information about products, such as their name, price, and category.
* **Orders:** This table stores information about orders, such as the customer who placed the order, the date the order was placed, and the products that were ordered.
* **Order Items:** This table stores information about the items that were ordered, such as the product that was ordered, the quantity that was ordered, and the price of the product.

## Queries

The queries for the sales database include the following:

* **Get Total Revenue by Product:** This query retrieves the total revenue generated by each product.
* **Get Most Popular Products:** This query retrieves the most popular products, based on the number of times they have been ordered.
* **Get Top Customers:** This query retrieves the top customers, based on the total amount of money they have spent.

## How to Use

To use the database schema and queries, you will need to have a database server installed on your computer. Once you have a database server installed, you can create the database and tables using the SQL scripts that are included in this project. You can then use the queries to retrieve data from the tables.
